My final aim is to know how to construct intent extractor mechanism for my gen ai / llm agent. So basically, being able to tell for every turn of conversation - which predetermined topic is a user interested in - from a preprepaped list of topics or is it continuation of conversation about previosly detected topic or does it not realate to my list of topics.

This task is easy if you have up to 5 general topics or 10 topics described just like questions that a user may ask. but what if a list of topics keeps growing.

Input message from a user is a text. Of course the topics are somehow interconnected, but i don't have mapped their relations out of the box.
